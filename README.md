# Mini Instagram Clone
A simple Instagram-like web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was created with the help of GitHub Copilot to explore AI-assisted development and practice building interactive web apps.

## Project Description

Mini Instagram Clone simulates the core features of a social media feed:
- Scrollable feed with multiple posts
- Each post displays a user avatar, username, image, caption
- Like button with a dynamic counter
- Comment section where users can type and submit comments
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

The goal of this project is to demonstrate building an interactive web interface entirely in the front-end, using AI to accelerate development.

## Features

- Fixed header with app name
- Scrollable feed with multiple posts
- Like button increments likes dynamically
- Comment input under each post displays submitted comments
- Responsive layout using CSS for mobile and desktop
- Basic styling with hover effects for interactivity

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-instagram.git
   cd mini-instagram
````

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

No additional dependencies or server setup is required since this is a front-end only project.

## Usage

1. Scroll through the feed to see posts.
2. Click the **♥ Like** button to increase the like counter.
3. Type a comment in the input box and press **Enter** to submit it.
4. Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Tip for Copilot:**  

You can ask it directly in VS Code like this:  

> "Update my README.md with a professional project description, installation instructions, usage guide, features, and technologies used for my Mini Instagram project."

Copilot will then generate a similar README, which you can review and tweak.

If you want, I can also **draft the REFLECTION.md** for Copilot usage so you can submit both files immediately. Do you want me to do that?
